			<description>&lt;p&gt;BY ROBERT FROST&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sorry I could not travel both&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And be one traveler, long I stood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And looked down one as far as I could&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To where it bent in the undergrowth;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first blog with the help of Hugo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第一天就发现hugo的换行有问题，加油！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;Good night!&lt;/p&gt;
